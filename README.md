# 📊 R Programming Basics and Data Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive introduction to R programming with practical examples for data analysis. The notebook is designed for beginners and intermediate users to understand R syntax, data structures, basic functions, data visualization, and real-world data analysis workflows.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
r_programming_1.ipynb  # Main Jupyter notebook with explanations and R code
```

## 🧠 Topics Covered

* Installing R packages
* Vectors, matrices, data frames, and lists
* Data import/export (CSV, Excel)
* Control structures (if, else, for, while)
* Functions and apply-family (`lapply`, `sapply`, `apply`, etc.)
* Data manipulation using `dplyr` and `tidyverse`
* Data visualization using `ggplot2`
* Summary statistics and exploratory data analysis
* Handling missing values
* Debugging and profiling in R

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
* [IRKernel](https://irkernel.github.io/) to run R in Jupyter Notebook (if using Jupyter)

Install required R packages:

```r
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyverse", "readr", "readxl", "data.table"))
```

If you're using Jupyter:

```r
install.packages('IRkernel')
IRkernel::installspec()
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/r-programming-basics.git
   cd r-programming-basics
   ```

2. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook r_programming_1.ipynb
   ```

Or open it directly in **RStudio** if using the built-in notebook interface.

## 📈 Sample Output

The notebook includes visualizations such as bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots built using `ggplot2`, along with in-depth explanations of each concept.
